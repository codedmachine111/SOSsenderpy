<h3>This is a python GUI program to send an email to your emergency contacts. (DO NOT USE THIS FOR SPAM!)</h3>
<p>The program uses the SMTP library in python to send emails with a standard TLS encryption.</p>
<br>
<p>Im still working on tracking the exact location of the device the program is being used on and send/attach the data in the email. If you can help me with this issue contact me<a href="mailto:charlesbabbage1709@hmail.com">here</a> .</p>
